## Context

### Problem Statement

Performance Events (★) are the most complex single-tick computation in the game.
A show processes a setlist music-by-music, part-by-part, with an audience that
reacts dynamically and fatigue accumulating across songs.

**Key design principles:**

1. **No idol substitution mid-show.** The group enters and performs together until
   the end. What changes between songs (and within songs) is the **position** each
   idol occupies — who sings lead, who dances front, who rests behind.

2. **Fatigue comes from the SONG, not from the position.** A ballad costs very
   little fatigue even for the center. A high-energy dance track costs a lot for
   everyone. Each song part has its own vocal_load and dance_load defined by the
   composition (ADR-008) and choreography.

3. **The show lineup is a 3D matrix:** Song × Idol × Part → Position.
   Every position has both vocal and dance components. What changes per position
   is how much of each the idol contributes.

4. **Solo shows are viable.** A solo idol can perform 10 songs if the songs are
   designed to be manageable (light vocal + light dance). The system must support
   1-idol shows and 12-idol group shows with the same data model.

## Decision

### 1. Show Rules

**The group leader is ALWAYS on stage.** This is an industry rule — the leader
represents the group and must be present in every song, every part. The leader
can be in any position (center, front, back, support) but can NEVER be removed
from the lineup. This constrains fatigue management: the leader cannot fully rest,
only move to lower-demand positions.

For solo shows: the solo idol is both leader and only performer — always on stage by definition.

### 2. Position Model

Every idol in every part of every song occupies a **position**. A position
defines HOW MUCH vocal and dance the idol performs in that moment:

```typescript
interface Position {
  // How much of the vocal this idol handles (0.0 = silent, 1.0 = solo vocal)
  // Sum of all idol vocal_share in one part should = 1.0
  vocalShare: number;

  // How much of the dance choreography (0.0 = standing still, 1.0 = full choreo)
  danceShare: number;

  // Stage placement (affects audience engagement weight)
  stagePlacement: 'center' | 'front' | 'mid' | 'back' | 'side';
}
```

The **actual fatigue cost** is then:

```
fatigue_for_idol_in_part =
  (song_part.vocalIntensity × position.vocalShare) +
  (song_part.danceIntensity × position.danceShare)
```

This means:
- **Ballad, center position, vocalShare 1.0, danceShare 0.0:**
  fatigue = (low_vocal × 1.0) + (zero_dance × 0.0) = very low
- **Dance track, front dancer, vocalShare 0.1, danceShare 1.0:**
  fatigue = (low_vocal × 0.1) + (high_dance × 1.0) = high
- **Solo bridge with only instrumental:**
  fatigue = (zero_vocal × 0.0) + (high_dance × 1.0) = moderate-high (dance solo)
- **Rest position (back, minimal everything):**
  fatigue = (any_vocal × 0.05) + (any_dance × 0.05) = near zero

### 3. Song Part Demands (from ADR-008)

Each song's composition and choreography define per-part demands:

```typescript
// From ADR-008 SongComposition.partDemands
interface PartDemands {
  vocalIntensity: number;    // 0-10 (0 = instrumental, 10 = belting chorus)
  danceIntensity: number;    // 0-10 (0 = standing, 10 = full choreography)
}

// Examples:
// Soft ballad verse:    { vocalIntensity: 3, danceIntensity: 0 }
// Power ballad chorus:  { vocalIntensity: 8, danceIntensity: 1 }
// Dance track chorus:   { vocalIntensity: 5, danceIntensity: 9 }
// Instrumental bridge:  { vocalIntensity: 0, danceIntensity: 7 } (dance solo)
// Quiet intro:          { vocalIntensity: 1, danceIntensity: 0 }
// Full energy finale:   { vocalIntensity: 9, danceIntensity: 9 }
```

These values are set when the song is composed (arrangement) and choreographed
(ADR-008 creative pipeline). They are **properties of the song**, not of the show.

### 4. Show Lineup: The 3D Matrix

The lineup is the complete assignment of every idol to a position in every part
of every song:

```typescript
interface ShowLineup {
  showId: string;
  // 3D matrix: song → part → idol → position
  assignments: SongLineup[];
}

interface SongLineup {
  songId: string;
  songIndex: number;  // order in setlist
  // For each part of this song, each idol's position
  parts: PartLineup[];
}

interface PartLineup {
  part: SongPart;  // 'intro' | 'verse_1' | 'chorus_1' | etc.
  // Each idol's position in this part
  positions: Map<string, Position>;  // idolId → Position
  // NOTE: sum of all vocalShare should ≈ 1.0
  // NOTE: sum of all danceShare can vary (choreo for N of M members)
}
```

**For a solo show:** the Map has 1 entry per part. The solo idol has
vocalShare: 1.0 and danceShare: 1.0 (or 0.0 for non-dance parts).

**For a group show:** each member has their own Position per part.
The choreography determines how many are actively dancing (danceShare > 0)
vs resting (danceShare ≈ 0.05 = minimal movement at back).

**Leader constraint:** The group leader MUST have an entry in every PartLineup
of every song. The leader's position can be anything (center, back, support) but
the entry must exist and `danceShare + vocalShare > 0` (leader is always visibly
participating, even if minimally). Validation: if any PartLineup is missing the
leader, it's an error — the lineup builder must enforce this.

### 5. Within-Song Rotations

The choreography can define rotations WITHIN a song:

```
Song "Starlight Dreams" (group of 6):
  Verse 1:  Yui center (vocal 0.7), Mei front-dance (dance 0.8), others mid
  Chorus 1: Mei center (dance 0.9), Yui back (vocal 0.3, rest), Riko lead-vocal (vocal 0.6)
  Verse 2:  Riko center (vocal 0.6), Yui mid (vocal 0.2, dance 0.3), Mei back (rest)
  Chorus 2: ALL front (vocal 0.16 each, dance 0.5 each) — unity moment
  Bridge:   Instrumental — Saki dance solo (dance 1.0, vocal 0.0), all others back
  Chorus 3: Yui + Mei center duo (vocal 0.4 each, dance 0.5 each), others support
```

This is all encoded in the PartLineup — each part can have completely different
positions for each idol. The matrix IS the choreography.

### 6. Between-Song Rotations

Between songs, the Show Director (ADR-009 decision 10.3.2) can modify the lineup
for the NEXT song based on accumulated fatigue:

```
After song 3, Show Director reads:
  Yui:  fatigue 28 (was center/lead in songs 1-3)
  Mei:  fatigue 22 (was front-dance in songs 1-3)
  Riko: fatigue 8  (was back/support in songs 1-3)

Song 4 is a high-energy dance track. Planned lineup had Yui center again.
Show Director (attr: Stage Presence ≥ 15) decides:
  → Swap Yui to back for song 4 (rest, fatigue cost ~2)
  → Move Riko to center for song 4 (she's fresh, fatigue only 8)
  → Yui returns to center for song 5 (recovered enough)

Modified lineup applied to song 4's PartLineup.
```

The rotation does NOT change who is on stage — only positions within the lineup.

### 8. Solo Show Support

A solo idol performing 10 songs uses the same 3D matrix, but with only 1 idol:

```
Solo show example — idol Yui, 10 songs:

Song 1 (uptempo pop):
  Verse 1:  { vocalShare: 1.0, danceShare: 0.6, stage: 'center' }
  Chorus 1: { vocalShare: 1.0, danceShare: 0.8, stage: 'center' }
  ...
  Fatigue per song: moderate (vocal 6 × 1.0 × 0.3 + dance 7 × 0.7 × 0.5 = 4.25/part)
  9 parts ≈ 38 fatigue. After 3 songs: ~114. Needs recovery.

Song 4 (ballad — designed light):
  All parts: { vocalShare: 1.0, danceShare: 0.0, stage: 'center' }
  partDemands: { vocalIntensity: 4, danceIntensity: 0 }
  Fatigue per song: 4 × 1.0 × 0.3 × 9 = 10.8. Recovery opportunity.

Song 5 (acoustic, sitting on stool):
  All parts: { vocalShare: 1.0, danceShare: 0.0, stage: 'center' }
  partDemands: { vocalIntensity: 3, danceIntensity: 0 }
  Fatigue: 8.1. Further recovery.

→ A well-designed solo setlist alternates heavy and light songs.
   The Music Director's (ADR-009) job is to compose songs with varied demands
   so the idol can sustain a full show.
```

### 9. Fatigue as Emergent from Song Design

**There are no fixed fatigue costs per position.** All fatigue emerges from:

```
fatigue = Σ (song_part.vocalIntensity × idol.vocalShare × VOCAL_FATIGUE_RATE
            + song_part.danceIntensity × idol.danceShare × DANCE_FATIGUE_RATE)
          for all parts of the song
```

This means:
- **Identical position, different songs = different fatigue.**
  Center in a ballad ≠ center in a dance anthem.
- **Same song, different positions = different fatigue.**
  Lead vocal in a chorus (vocal high, dance low) ≠ front dancer in a chorus (vocal low, dance high).
- **Song design IS fatigue design.**
  The Music Director (ADR-009) and the composer control how demanding each song is.
  A smart A&R creates a diverse catalogue: some light songs, some heavy,
  specifically so the Show Director can build setlists that manage fatigue.
- **Solo shows require lighter songs.**
  If all 10 songs are high-energy dance tracks, even a top idol can't sustain it.
  The A&R must create ballads and acoustic numbers for solo setlists.

### 10. Audience Dynamics

`AudienceState` is transient — created at show start, discarded after settlement.

```typescript
interface AudienceState {
  total: number;
  composition: { casual: number; dedicated: number; hardcore: number; general: number };
  engagement: number;      // 0-100, accumulates per song
  energy: number;          // 0-100, fluctuates based on song energy
  emotionalState: 'cold' | 'warm' | 'hot' | 'euphoric';
  lightstickDistribution: Map<string, number>;  // idolId → share (sum = 1.0)
}

// Audience energy follows song demands:
// High danceIntensity song → audience energy rises
// Ballad → audience energy dips (but engagement can rise via emotion)
// Bad performance → energy drops sharply
// Encore → energy floor 70 (fans are already hyped)

// Emotional state transitions:
// cold → warm: engagement > 30
// warm → hot: engagement > 60 AND energy > 50
// hot → euphoric: engagement > 80 AND last song was S-grade
// Any → cold: if 2 consecutive songs scored D or F
```

### 11. Part Weights for Song Score

```
Part weights (sum = 1.0):
  intro:       0.05
  verse_1:     0.10
  pre_chorus:  0.08
  chorus_1:    0.18   (hook — highest weight)
  verse_2:     0.08
  chorus_2:    0.15
  bridge:      0.12   (contrast — key moment for drama)
  chorus_3:    0.16   (climax)
  outro:       0.08

Chorus total ≈ 49%. The chorus performances matter most.
```

## Performance Budget

- Pre-show setup: <0.3ms
- Per-song: ~0.15ms (parts × idols × computations)
  - 15 songs × 0.15ms = 2.25ms
- Post-show: <0.5ms
- **Total: ~3ms per show** (within budget)

For 12-member groups: 12 idols × 9 parts × score computation per song.
15 songs = ~1,620 score computations total — trivial for JS.

## Tuning Knobs

| Knob | Default | Range | Effect |
|------|---------|-------|--------|
| `VOCAL_FATIGUE_RATE` | 0.3 | 0.1-0.5 | How fast vocal effort tires idols |
| `DANCE_FATIGUE_RATE` | 0.5 | 0.2-0.8 | How fast physical effort tires idols |
| `FATIGUE_PENALTY_THRESHOLDS` | [30,50,70,90] | adjustable | When penalties kick in |
| `FATIGUE_PENALTY_VALUES` | [0,0.05,0.15,0.30,0.50] | adjustable | How much fatigue hurts |
| `MC_REST_RECOVERY` | 5 | 2-10 | Fatigue recovered during MC/interlude |
| `ENCORE_BASE_CHANCE` | 0.3 | 0.1-0.6 | Base probability of encore trigger |
| `STAGE_PLACEMENT_MULT` | center:1.5, front:1.2, mid:1.0, back:0.6, side:0.7 | adjustable | Audience engagement by placement |

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Fixed fatigue cost per position (original ADR-007 v2)

- **Description**: center = 12 fatigue, lead_vocal = 10, rest = 1, regardless of song.
- **Rejection Reason**: A ballad center costs the same as a dance anthem center, which
  is wrong. Fatigue must come from the song's demands, not from the position label.
  Songs are the unit of design; positions are just how idols distribute the work.

### Alternative 2: Idol substitution mid-show

- **Rejection Reason**: Not realistic for idol industry. Groups perform together.
  What changes is roles/positions, not who is on stage.

### Alternative 3: 2D lineup (Song × Idol → fixed role per song)

- **Description**: Each idol has one role for the entire song.
- **Rejection Reason**: Misses within-song rotations (center changes between verse
  and chorus). The choreography IS the within-song position changes. The 3D matrix
  (Song × Part × Idol → Position) captures this accurately.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Fatigue is physically accurate (depends on actual demands, not labels)
- Same model works for solo and group shows
- Song design directly creates show-level strategy (light vs heavy songs)
- Within-song rotations are part of the choreography, not a separate mechanic
- A&R and Show Director roles are deeply connected (song design enables show quality)

### Negative
- 3D matrix is large (15 songs × 9 parts × 12 idols = 1,620 positions)
- Complex to visualize in UI (needs good abstraction for player)
- Tuning 2 fatigue rates + 5 penalty thresholds is delicate

### Risks
- **Risk**: 3D lineup matrix is too complex for NPC Show Director to fill
  - **Mitigation**: ADR-009 10.3.1 builds lineup based on templates and heuristics.
    NPC fills "center" and "rest" broadly; per-part detail comes from choreography.
- **Risk**: Player overwhelmed by per-part position setting
  - **Mitigation**: UI shows per-SONG lineup. Per-part is auto-filled from choreography.
    Player only overrides at song level ("Yui is center for this song").
    Within-song rotations come from the choreography design, not manual player input.
